        Define subscription tiers or freemium model.  
        Set target MRR and customer acquisition goals.
    Prompt Example: “Analyze the market for [app idea]. Identify competitors, target audience pain points, and suggest a monetization strategy.”

Step 2: UI Design with Lovable 🎨

    Objective: Create a user-friendly, conversion-optimized interface.  
    Actions:  
        Use Lovable to design static screens (e.g., landing, dashboard, pricing).  
        Focus on user journey from landing to signup/conversion.  
        Export UI to GitHub.
    Prompt Example: “Generate a React UI for [app goal] with screens: [list screens]. Optimize for user conversion.”

Step 3: Development with Cursor ⚙️

    Objective: Build features incrementally with robust error handling.  
    Actions:  
        Clone GitHub repo and open in Cursor.  
        Generate /docs/vision.md and /docs/structure.md for context.  
        Implement features one by one (e.g., user auth, payment integration).  
        Add console.log for debugging and error handling for each feature.  
        Integrate Supabase for auth and database.
    Prompt Example: “Implement [feature] with error handling and logging. Update /docs/structure.md with new routes and tech.”

Step 4: Monetization Integration 💰

    Objective: Enable revenue generation early.  
    Actions:  
        Integrate payment gateways (e.g., Stripe, PayPal) via Cursor.  
        Test billing flows (subscriptions, one-time payments).  
        Implement tiered access based on subscription level.
    Prompt Example: “Add Stripe integration for [subscription tiers]. Ensure secure payment handling and access control.”

Step 5: Testing & Security 🧪

    Objective: Ensure functionality, usability, and security.  
    Actions:  
        Use AI testing tools (e.g., Testim) for automated functional tests.  
        Run security audits with AI (e.g., check for OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities).  
        Test across browsers and devices.
    Prompt Example: “Generate test scripts for [feature]. Identify and fix security vulnerabilities.”

Step 6: Deployment & Scaling 🚀

    Objective: Launch on scalable infrastructure.  
    Actions:  
        Deploy via Vercel, Netlify, or AWS Amplify.  
        Set up auto-scaling and load balancing.  
        Implement monitoring (e.g., Sentry for errors, Google Analytics for traffic).
    Prompt Example: “Deploy the app to [platform]. Configure auto-scaling and error monitoring.”

Step 7: Marketing & Launch 📣

    Objective: Drive traffic and conversions.  
    Actions:  
        Use AI tools (e.g., Jasper) to generate blog posts, ads, and landing page copy.  
        Optimize SEO with AI (e.g., keyword research, meta tags).  
        Set up A/B tests for landing pages.
    Prompt Example: “Write a high-converting landing page for [app]. Include SEO-optimized headlines and CTAs.”

Step 8: Customer Acquisition & Retention 🤝

    Objective: Grow user base and reduce churn.  
    Actions:  
        Launch paid ads (Google, Facebook) with AI-optimized targeting.  
        Implement AI-driven email marketing (e.g., personalized drip campaigns).  
        Use chatbots (e.g., Intercom) for onboarding and support.  
        Analyze churn with AI to identify at-risk users.
    Prompt Example: “Create a drip email sequence for new users. Personalize based on [user behavior].”

Step 9: Iteration & Growth 📈

    Objective: Continuously improve based on data.  
    Actions:  
        Track MRR, CAC, LTV, and churn with analytics.  
        Use AI to identify feature requests or pain points from user feedback.  
        Prioritize updates that drive retention or upsells.
    Prompt Example: “Analyze user feedback for [app]. Suggest top 3 features to build next.”
