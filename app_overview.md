# **BrewFood Connect â€” App Overview**

## ðŸ§  What It Is  
**BrewFood Connect** is a scheduling and communication platform purpose-built for **breweries** and **mobile food vendors**. It streamlines the entire vendor booking workflow by centralizing **availability**, **requests**, and **real-time communication** â€” eliminating the need for Instagram DMs, text threads, and manual calendars.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Core Problem  
Breweries rely on food vendors to boost taproom attendance but waste time coordinating over scattered channels. Food vendors struggle to find quality gigs and manage communications with multiple locations. Scheduling is disorganized, slow, and easy to mess up.

---

## âœ… Solution  
BrewFood Connect creates a shared, professional-grade toolset for both parties:

- **Breweries**:
  - Create and manage a calendar of open food vendor slots
  - Get booking requests from interested vendors
  - Approve or decline with one click
  - Communicate directly with vendors via in-app chat, email, or SMS

- **Vendors**:
  - Browse brewery availability by date and location
  - Request bookings directly in the app
  - Receive confirmations or follow-ups through in-app messaging, SMS, and email
  - Stay organized with a built-in calendar of upcoming events

---

## ðŸ“² Communication Is Built-In (Required)

- **ðŸ“¥ In-App Messaging**: Each booking request creates a message thread between the brewery and vendor.  
- **ðŸ“§ Email Notifications**: Confirmations, changes, or unread messages trigger emails.  
- **ðŸ“± SMS Alerts**: Time-sensitive notifications (booking confirmed, slot opening, message received) are also sent via SMS.  
- These channels ensure both parties stay aligned without leaving the platform.

- **Vendor:** Filters for available Friday night slots within 10 miles  
- **Booking:** Vendor requests 4/12, Brewery sees profile + approves  
- **Comms:** Vendor sends message asking about power hookup â€” brewery replies in-app, vendor gets notified via SMS/email  
- **Calendar:** Event is automatically added to both dashboards

## ðŸ“ˆ Why This Matters Now
